    <p class="donate-section"><strong>Family Background:</strong> Varshini R is a 6th-grade student at Rani Matric Hr. Sec. School. She is a sweet and bright child with dreams as big as her heart. But behind her innocent smile lies the quiet struggle of a family fighting to survive each day.

      Her father works as a daily wage laborer in a mosquito net manufacturing unit, doing everything he can to support the family. Her mother is a housewife, and together they are trying their best—but it’s not enough. Some days, they struggle just to afford a simple meal.
      
      Despite the hardships, Varshini remains determined to continue her education, showing up to school with hope in her eyes and a will to learn. But her family is in urgent need of support—for food, school fees, and basic needs.
      
      Your kindness can be the light that helps Varshini and her family through this dark time. Even a small donation can make a big difference in giving her a chance at a better future. </p>
