      Her father works as a daily wage laborer in a mosquito net manufacturing unit, doing all he can to make ends meet. Her mother is a housewife, and the family often finds it difficult to put even a basic meal on the table.
      
      They have faced many challenges in life and continue to struggle for even the most essential needs like food and school expenses. Despite it all, Riona continues to go to school with hope in her eyes.
      
      Your support can help bring stability to their life and give Riona the chance to grow, learn, and chase the future she deserves. Even a small contribution can make a big difference for this family. </p>
